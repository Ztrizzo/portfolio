Created a fully customized portal website for a client's partners. This site gave users full access to interact with data on Salesforce without having to worry about the complexities of that platform.<br>
  
The website allowed users to grant or loan funds to various charitable organizations. I worked with one other developer on a team in order to deliver the following functionality to users:<br>

 - Full integration with Stripe to allow users to contribute funds from bank accounts and credit cards
 - Ability for account owners to control permissions for other users on the account
 - Ability to transfer funds between accounts
 - Visibility on all documents related to the users' accounts
 - Personalized messaging for each user
