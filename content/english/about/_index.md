Hello! I'm Zach Rizzo, a dedicated Frontend Developer based in Madison, Wisconsin. With 1.5 years of professional experience in the tech industry, I specialize in creating dynamic and user-friendly web interfaces that enhance user experience.

My journey into web development is unique, having transitioned from a 5-year tenure as a factory worker in the manufacturing sector. This background instilled in me a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and the ability to thrive in fast-paced environments. These skills have seamlessly translated into my coding career, where I am continuously driven by the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant digital solutions.
